# Purrfect Products!

This is my implementation of [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy9SdZLBTOo), which is a full-stack e-commerce site.

I opted to use some `styled-components` and also took advantage of the `@reduxjs/toolkit`, among other significant changes.

# To-Do

- Render Products Admin page for admins only
- Profile page
- Post-order "Thank You" page
  - Updates state and inventory
- Image upload on Add Product page
  - Move all local images to the cloud first
